### **Project Management/Task Delegation**

In our full-stack web application project we started by having a discussion about our individual strengths and weaknesses and then divided our work load between our group depending on those strengths. Essentially the work was divided into three main parts where each team member would focus on one main aspect. Front-end development which focused primarily on React framework and included importing npm packages, creating and implementing components, and styling. Back-end development which focused primarily on the Rails framework and included installing gems, creating models and controllers, organizing the database and implementing third party servers like Cloudinary. Testing and documentation which focused on implementing tests for both front and back-end frameworks, hard coding JSX text for the site, creating dummy data such as seeds for the database and recording the necessary documentation for the project.
We utilized a Trello board to keep track of our job boards with achievable goal dates. And we conducted our own informal stand-ups each morning where would  discuss current progress, outstanding issues and then outline the tasks for the day. Throughout the development of the application we found that the back-end was easier to implement than the front-end. In this case our back-end team member assisted our front-end developer with more difficult logic to allow them more freedom to bulk the project out.
